# SpringBootNeo4jDemo
Demo project using spring boot with the neo4j data starter for a simple student - department graph database

Also using this project to become familiar with using postman to test REST api using post requests. For example the create student request accepts a json file from 
the body of the post request to fill in the student details which are then updated in the neo4j database.
